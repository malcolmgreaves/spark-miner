# spark-miner
Text mining/preprocessing package for Spark. This package is purely a pet project. 

## 1. Keyword extraction
Keyword extraction is tasked with the automatic identification of terms that best describe the subject of a document.

Supported algorithms (implemented or on the roadmap):

1) Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) as described in Text Mining: Applications and Theory by Michael W. Berry, Jacob Cogan.

2) TextRank as described in TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts by Rada Mihalcea and Paul Tarau.

3) Maui as described in Human-competitive automated topic indexing by Olena Medelyan

## 2. Embedding
[Word|Phrase] Embedding is a technique for transforming words or phrases from the vocabulary into vectors of real numbers in a low-dimensional space relative to the vocabulary size.

Supported algorithms (implemented or on the roadmap):

1) GloVe as descibed in Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. 2014. GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation.
