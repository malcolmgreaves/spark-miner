# spark-keywords
Keyword extraction package for Spark. This package is purely a pet project. Keyword extraction is tasked with the automatic identification of terms that best describe the subject of a document.

Supported algorithms (implemented or on the roadmap):

1) Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) as described in Text Mining: Applications and Theory by Michael W. Berry, Jacob Cogan.

2) TextRank as described in TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts by Rada Mihalcea and Paul Tarau.

3) Maui as described in Human-competitive automated topic indexing by Olena Medelyan
